/*
 * --- JavaScript Control Flow
 * Control flow is the order in which statements are executed in a program. 
 * The default control flow is for statements to be read and executed in order from left-to-right, 
 * top-to-bottom in a program file.
 * 
 * Control structures such as conditionals
 * alter control flow by only executing blocks of code if certain conditions are met. 
 * These structures essentially allow a program to make decisions about 
 * which code is executed as the program runs.
